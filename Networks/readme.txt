Each file contains the Global Exposure network for the months of October and December. Each network represents exposure between various socio-economic groups within the population of the city of Salvador, Brazil.

Each node captures a specific combination of factors (gender, age group, and social class). Gender (Female, Male), age groups (18-24, 25-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80+), and social class (A, B, C, D, E)

The edges between these nodes indicate the average probability of exposure between these groups across all census tracts, essentially acting as weights on the connections. The network has 80 distinct nodes and 3160 edges forming a single connected component.
